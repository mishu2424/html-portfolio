<h1>The Best Movies According to Mishu</h1>
 <h3>My Top 3 Movies of all-time </h3>

 <hr />

 <h4>Shawshunk Redemption </h4>
 <p> A simple story, nicely executed.  </p>

 <h4>12th fail </h4>
 <p>I found 12th Fail to be a fascinating movie on a very important issue i.e Aspiration, Failure and Pursuit of Success.</p>

 <h4>3 idiots</h4>
 <p>The “3 Idiots” movie teaches us that a certificate is nothing more than a piece of paper. Real education is to acquire knowledge.</p>
